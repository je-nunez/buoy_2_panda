# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# INFO

Get the waves time-series of a National Buoy Data Center buoy into a Panda dataframe, using buoyant.

This example also creates a PNG file with the plot of those time-series (after normalization, so all the time-series may be combined into a single plot).
